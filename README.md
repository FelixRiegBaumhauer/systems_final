-Group Members:
FELIX RIEG-BAUMHAUER, NOAH FICHTER, SEBASTAIN CAIN

-Instructions:

1. Use the makefile to compile the project

2. Open up three termainal windows, one three differing computers, one of them must be bart

3. On the termainla window where bart is located, run the server

4. Do this by typing: $./server

5. On the two other computers run the clients, aptlly named c4

6. Run c4 by typing: $./c4

7. Follow the on screen intrstructions, create a username, of maximum 12 charechters

8. If want to create a game (one of two compuetrs will have to create one), type c, if you want to join a game type j

9. Reminder, if there are no games to join, you can't do so, thus the first user should create a game

10. Enter the remaining information correctlly (be sure to kep the information taht you enter smalled than 12 charecters)

11. Important note: the password feature was droped, as such when prompted by the program to enter a password after having chosen to join a game, just hit enter

12. Now proceed to play connect4.

Notes:
If you area luddite, and would preffer to not use the interwebs to connect with a connect 4 partner, the "$make" command also creates game.c, if you run, "$./game", you will be able to play connect four locally on your own machine. It is the same game as the one being beamed across the internet.


Bugs:

Dropped Features:
Due to time issues.
-Password protected games (the password functionallity in our game does not really exist)
-non 2 dimensional multiplayer 
-GUI

-Purpose: 
online connect four
This project exists for those individuals who have a strong urge to play connect four with a distant friend. In this case, the user is to eneter the IP address of a common server (ie a third friend who is the odd man out) and begin playing with their (more important) friend.

-Programs needed to be intalled to run project:
NONE
