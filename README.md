team: "get back to us"

-Group Members:
FELIX RIEG-BAUMHAUER, NOAH FICHTER, SEBASTAIN CAIN

-Instructions:

1. Use the makefile to compile the project.

2. Open up three termainal windows, one three differing computers, one of them must be bart.

3. On the termainal window where bart is located, run the server.

4. Do this by typing: $./server.

5. On the two other computers run the clients, aptlly named c4. 

6. Run c4 by typing: $./c4--you will be asked to enter the IP address of a computer that is running the server. That computer must allready be running the server.

7. Follow the on screen intrstructions, create a username, we would strongly encourge the user to make their games public, as the private functionality is rather underdeveloped.

8. If youwant to create a game (one of two computers will have to create one), type c, if you want to join a game type j.

9. Reminder: if there are no games to join, you can't do so, thus the first user should create a game.

10. Enter the remaining information correctly.

11. Important note: the password feature was droped, as such when prompted by the program to enter a password after having chosen to join a game, just hit enter, or most "normal" keys.

12. Now proceed to play connect4, and remember, this is a CS class, so 0 represents the first column.

Notes:
-ALthough it may irk some of the skilled video game players in this class, our program has some intentional lag. If you eneter a value, give the computer 5 seconds or so, the screen should update as desired.
-If you are a luddite, and would prefer to not use the interwebs to connect with a connect 4 partner, the "$make" command also creates exec file game, if you run, "$./game", you will be able to play connect four locally on your own machine. It is the same game as the one being beamed across the internet.


Dropped Features:
Due to time issues.
-Password protected games (the password functionality in our game does not really exist)
-non 2 dimensional multiplayer 
-GUI

-Purpose: 
online connect four
This project exists for those individuals who have a strong urge to play connect four with a distant friend. In this case, the user is to eneter the IP address of a common server (ie a third friend who is the odd man out) and begin playing with their (more important) friend.

-Programs needed to be intalled to run project:
NONE
